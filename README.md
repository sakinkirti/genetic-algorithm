A short project where I am exploring the creation of a small genetic algorithm <br>
Is paired with a short demonstration when running evolution.py <br>

## Relevant Files
- `evolution.py` contains the main method to run the program
- `population.py` stores each [mouse] in a list and contains methods to loop through updating the mouse locations
- `mouse.py` stores mouse characteristics such as [DNA] and contains methods to update the mouse position, velocity, and acceleration
- `DNA.py` stores the genetic information telling the [mouse] where to go
- `cheese.py` stores the goal and is used to help calculate fitness

## Additional Files
- `graphics.py` contains the graphics methods to used to create this project: Young, Daniel. Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science. 2018. 2022. GitHub, https://github.com/drypycode/zelle-python/blob/ccd781784bf2a635d1f6e84ec2173d2ae7d50098/graphics.py.
